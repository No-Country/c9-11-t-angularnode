# Urban Food

Urban Food is a fast food restaurant. We created an e-commerce website that allows clients to make orders. The client can visualize the different products of the restaurant and add them to his cart. Once the checkout process is finished, the user will be redirected to WhatsApp, with a pre-created message that contains the order details.
